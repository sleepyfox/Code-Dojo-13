Code Dojo 13
============
This is my worked example from the 13th meeting of the London Code Dojo in early Nov 2012. Feel free to play around with it. You can run the code (assuming you have node, coffeescript, mocha and chai installed) with:

    npm test

You can install dependencies automatically with:

    npm install

I set up a watchr file (loc.watchr) so that the tests are run automatically every time you save a file in your editor, simply run watchr (if installed) with:

    watchr loc.watchr

The kata is detailed in the top-level [README](../README.md).
