Code Dojo 13
============
This git repository contains code related to the 13th meeting of the London Code Dojo in early Nov 2012. Feel free to play around with it.

The source of the kata is the LOC kata, which I first used in London Code Dojo 4, 

The objective is to create a program that will take a Java code file and count the number of Lines Of Code (LOC). This is not quite as easy as `wc -l` because blank lines must be skipped over, as must comments. Comments can be single-line, multiple-line or javadoc comments.

You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at our [homepage](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).

The origin of this kata is from the Pragmatic Programmers, [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata13-counting-code-lines/).
